# peloton-design

Before you work on a major feature, create a pull request for your design doc in this repo.

Create a folder for each design doc, with the doc itself in .md and any resources
(diagram you include in the .md file, for example) in the folder. If you use a drawing
software, it will be great to include the source file so others can modify it later on.
